# Lightning Podoboo

Makes fire created by natural lightning cosmetic, meaning no blocks are destroyed during thunderstorms.  
Keep the `doFireTick` gamerule enabled without worrying about random fire destroying your builds or nearby trees!

## Download

You can download Lightning Podoboo from the following sources:

  - [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/lightning-podoboo)
  - [Github Releases](https://github.com/LostLuma/Lightning-Podoboo/releases)

## Installation

Ensure you've installed the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer) or [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/install) Loader and drop Lightning Podoboo into your mods folder.  
When used on a multiplayer server players connecting do not need to install this mod, and see no benefit from doing so.

## Motivation

This mod was created to work in tandem with the popular anti ender grief datapacks, disabling an annoying part of the game without causing any unintended side-effects while doing so:

- Fire from other sources burns down blocks as usual
- Lightning created through tridents spawns vanilla fire
- You (and other entities) will still burn when hit by lightning
